# Cluster Analysis

The project involves analyzing a mall customer dataset to achieve customer segmentation and create buyer personas. The assignment entails applying clustering techniques on demographic and purchasing data of 200 customers to group them into 2 clusters. The task also involves selecting two variables for visualization, describing a buyer persona for each cluster using provided examples and templates, and exploring clustering with 3, 4, or 5 clusters to visualize differences. Lastly, determining the optimal number of clusters is a key aspect of the analysis. This project aims to enhance understanding of customer behavior and preferences for effective marketing strategies.

The project aims to answer the following questions
* cluster 200 customers to 2 group based on their demographic and purchasing record
* Choosing two variables and visualizing the clustering.
* Describe a buyer persona for each cluster (examples and template are provided in the lab session slides)
* How about 3, 4 or 5 clusters? Visualize the difference. 
* What is the optimal number of clusters?
